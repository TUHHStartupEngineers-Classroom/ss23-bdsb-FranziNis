# Challenge 2.1

For the first challenge I looked up the weather in Moliets-et-Maa since this is one of my vacation destinations for this summer.

# Moliets' weather forecast for the next 16 days (21.05.2023) ----

html_weather    <- weather_moliets %>%
  read_html()

# The first week had another node than the last days, so I had to extract them two different ways and eventually add them back together
date_8to16 <- html_weather %>%
  html_nodes(".no-hover .date")%>%
  html_text() %>%
  stringr::str_extract("\\w+[:space:]\\d+\\.\\d+\\.") 
date_8to16

date_merged <- html_weather %>%
  html_nodes(".bg--blue-gradient .date") %>% # these are only the first 7 days
  html_text() %>%
  c(date_8to16) # so I added the last 11 days
date_merged 

weekday <- date_merged %>%
  stringr::str_extract("\\w+") # removes the date
weekday

# Create a year vector, so I can add it to the date (dd.mm.) to turn it into the date format
year <- c("2023","2023","2023","2023","2023",
          "2023","2023","2023","2023","2023",
          "2023","2023","2023","2023","2023","2023") # I didn't know how to make it pretty

  stringr::str_extract("\\d+\\.\\d+\\.") %>%  # extracting the weekday
  paste(year) %>%
  stringr::str_remove("[:space:]") %>% # removing the space

date

max_temp <- html_weather %>%

max_temp

min_temp <- html_weather %>%

  html_nodes(".weather-state") %>%
  html_text() %>%
  stringr::str_extract("\\w+[:space:]\\w+|\\w+") # wasn't pretty w/o the extraction

# The final tibble
Weather_tbl_joined <- tibble(date, weekday, max_temp, min_temp, weather_state)
